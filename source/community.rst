Community functionality
=======================

5.1 Getting started with community functionality
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
**Community Health Work** access to a health provider is something that is commonly taken for granted. From a kenyan perspective, the doctor to patient ratio is approximately 2:10000, implying that there are chances you may not get to see one in your lifetime!.

Community Health workers come in to change that.

A community health worker is trained to provide the most essential life saving interventions such
as emergency care. They also equip families with knowledge and skills to prevent diseases.
They Promote sanitation, hygiene, and good nutrition.

The community module is primarily meant for recording household visits/episodes that are done by Community Health Workers. To achieve this, the following distinct activities are defined:

In the community module, we have several other sub-modules which include, **Household , Household head, Household relationship, household visits, self training and reports**.
